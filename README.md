# Digit_Predictor

## Dataset
- The Dataset comes from Kaggle.com
- The purpose of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm that can predict digits as accurately as possible.

## Models
- The most accurate current model had an accuracy of around .96.
- More models are being run, and hopefully the accuracy of the best model will continue to increase.
